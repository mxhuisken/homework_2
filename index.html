        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>Hi!! I'm Marina, an aspiring software developer based in Irvine, California. </p>

        <p>Very excited to have started this program at UCI. Trying to learn as much as possible over the next 6 months. By this time next year I would love to be working at slack or another fun tech company.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="tunatxt"> I am using these pieces of "work" as filler for imaginary projects. Eventually, I would like to build an app to track my cats mood, set reminders for when to feed her. Allow the app to send me daily pics and imaginary quotes she would want to say to me. I could expand this to be an app where any pet parent can upload info about their animals to get the same experience! </p>

        <div>
            <p class="cowtxt"> Another imaginary project for cow lovers. This app will send daily cow facts along with a picture of a cute cow. This app will also have info on resources for local farm animal sancuatries for the users area. This app will also focus on pushing a vegan agenda. </p>
