            <p class="sectionp">Marina: many many words to say about myself..jk....in a years time there should be much more that I can add to this. For now, I can say I am a young professional trying to take in as much info as I can while in this program. In the next 5 yrs I hope to be working as a creative, innovative and passionate software developer!</p>
